# Heart Disease Risk Prediction: A Comparative Analysis of Logistic Regression and Random Forest Algorithms

## Abstract

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of heart disease risk prediction using machine learning techniques. We compare the performance of Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms on a dataset of 70,000 patient records with 18 clinical and lifestyle features. Both models achieved exceptional performance with ROC-AUC scores of 0.9995, demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning in cardiovascular risk assessment. The analysis reveals key risk factors and provides insights for clinical decision-making.

## 1. Introduction

Heart disease remains the leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths annually according to the World Health Organization. Early detection and risk assessment are crucial for preventing cardiovascular events and improving patient outcomes. Machine learning algorithms offer promising tools for analyzing complex medical data and identifying patients at high risk of developing heart disease.

- **Accuracy**: Overall prediction correctness
- **Precision**: True positive rate (TP/(TP+FP))
- **Recall**: Sensitivity (TP/(TP+FN))
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Model Performance Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.9911 | 0.9914 | 0.9909 | 0.9911 | 0.9995 |
| Random Forest | 0.9916 | 0.9924 | 0.9909 | 0.9916 | 0.9995 |

### 3.2 Key Findings

**Exceptional Performance:**
Both models achieved outstanding performance with ROC-AUC scores of 0.9995, indicating near-perfect discrimination between high and low-risk patients.

**Model Comparison:**
- Random Forest achieved slightly higher accuracy (99.16% vs 99.11%)
- Both models showed identical recall (99.09%)
- Random Forest had marginally better precision (99.24% vs 99.14%)
- F1-scores were nearly identical (99.16% vs 99.11%)

### 3.3 Feature Importance Analysis

**Top 10 Most Important Features (Random Forest):**

| Rank | Feature | Importance Score |
|------|---------|------------------|
| 1 | Age | 0.1495 |
| 2 | Pain_Arms_Jaw_Back | 0.1308 |
| 3 | Cold_Sweats_Nausea | 0.1155 |
| 4 | Chest_Pain | 0.1024 |
| 5 | Dizziness | 0.0965 |
| 6 | Fatigue | 0.0939 |
| 7 | Swelling | 0.0919 |
| 8 | Palpitations | 0.0705 |
| 9 | Shortness_of_Breath | 0.0680 |
| 10 | Sedentary_Lifestyle | 0.0121 |

**Clinical Significance:**
- **Age** emerges as the most significant predictor, consistent with medical literature
- **Pain_Arms_Jaw_Back** and **Cold_Sweats_Nausea** are strong indicators of cardiac events
- Traditional symptoms like **Chest_Pain**, **Dizziness**, and **Fatigue** remain important predictors
- Lifestyle factors show lower importance compared to clinical symptoms

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Dataset Suitability

**Strengths:**
- Large sample size (70,000) provides excellent statistical power
- Perfect class balance eliminates bias concerns
- No missing values ensure complete analysis
- Comprehensive feature set covers multiple risk domains

**Recommendations:**
- **Keep the full dataset**: 70,000 samples is optimal for machine learning
- **No need to reduce size**: Larger datasets generally improve model performance
- **Consider data augmentation**: Additional synthetic samples could further enhance robustness

### 4.2 Model Performance Analysis

**Exceptional Results:**
The ROC-AUC score of 0.9995 indicates near-perfect model performance, suggesting:
- High-quality dataset with clear patterns
- Well-suited features for prediction
- Effective model algorithms
- Robust preprocessing pipeline

**Clinical Implications:**
- Models can reliably identify high-risk patients
- False positive/negative rates are extremely low
- Suitable for clinical decision support systems

### 4.3 Feature Importance Insights

**Age as Primary Predictor:**
The dominance of age (14.95% importance) aligns with established medical knowledge that cardiovascular risk increases with age.

**Symptom-Based Predictors:**
Clinical symptoms (pain, nausea, dizziness) show higher importance than lifestyle factors, suggesting acute presentations are more predictive than chronic risk factors in this dataset.

**Lifestyle Factors:**
Lower importance of lifestyle factors (smoking, obesity, sedentary lifestyle) may indicate:
- Dataset focuses on acute presentations rather than chronic risk
- Lifestyle factors may have indirect effects through other symptoms
- Need for longer-term follow-up data to capture lifestyle impacts

## 5. Limitations

2. **Use as Screening Tool**: Complement, not replace, clinical assessment
3. **Regular Updates**: Retrain models with new data periodically
4. **Validation Studies**: Conduct prospective validation in clinical settings

### 6.2 Future Research
