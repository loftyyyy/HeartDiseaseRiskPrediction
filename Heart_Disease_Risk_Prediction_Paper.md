# Predicting Heart Disease Risk: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models

## Abstract

This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms for predicting heart disease risk. We evaluate the performance of Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms on a dataset of 70,000 patient records with 18 clinical and lifestyle features. Our analysis includes thorough data quality assessment, preprocessing techniques, duplicate impact analysis, and model evaluation using multiple performance metrics. Both models achieved exceptional performance with ROC-AUC scores of 0.9995, demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning in cardiovascular risk assessment. The study identifies key risk factors, validates that duplicate records represent legitimate patient profiles without inflating performance, and provides recommendations for clinical implementation. The findings contribute to the growing body of research on AI-assisted healthcare diagnostics and offer practical insights for medical decision support systems.

## 1. Introduction

Heart disease remains the leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths annually according to the World Health Organization. Early detection and risk assessment are crucial for preventing cardiovascular events and improving patient outcomes. Machine learning algorithms offer promising tools for analyzing complex medical data and identifying patients at high risk of developing heart disease.

The integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare has shown remarkable potential in diagnostic accuracy, treatment optimization, and risk stratification. Machine learning models can process vast amounts of patient data to identify patterns that may not be immediately apparent to human clinicians, potentially leading to earlier intervention and improved patient outcomes.

### 1.1 Objectives

The primary objectives of this study are to:
- Compare the performance of Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms for heart disease risk prediction
- Conduct comprehensive data quality assessment and preprocessing analysis
- Identify the most significant risk factors contributing to cardiovascular disease
- Evaluate the suitability of the dataset for machine learning applications
- Provide recommendations for clinical implementation and future research directions

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Gathering

The dataset used in this study consists of 70,000 patient records collected for heart disease risk assessment. The data includes comprehensive clinical and lifestyle information from patients across different demographics and health conditions.

**Data Source:**
- **Dataset**: Heart Disease Risk Dataset (EarlyMed)
- **Format**: CSV file with structured patient records
- **Collection Period**: Comprehensive dataset covering diverse patient populations
- **Ethical Considerations**: Dataset contains anonymized patient information suitable for research purposes

**Data Characteristics:**
- **Total Records**: 70,000 patient samples
- **Features**: 18 clinical and lifestyle predictors
- **Target Variable**: Binary heart disease risk classification
- **Data Quality**: High-quality dataset with comprehensive feature coverage

### 2.2 Data Analysis

The Heart Disease Risk dataset is a CSV file with a comprehensive collection of patient health measurements and assessments regarding the risk of cardiovascular disease. Each row in the dataset represents a specific patient record, and the "Heart_Risk" column is a vital indicator of cardiovascular risk classification. The dataset includes nineteen columns that provide information on parameters such as Chest_Pain, Shortness_of_Breath, Fatigue, Palpitations, Dizziness, Swelling, Pain_Arms_Jaw_Back, Cold_Sweats_Nausea, High_BP, High_Cholesterol, Diabetes, Smoking, Obesity, Sedentary_Lifestyle, Family_History, Chronic_Stress, Gender, Age, and the crucial "Heart_Risk" variable.

As shown in Table 1, all columns demonstrate exceptional data quality with zero missing values across the entire dataset. The binary features including "Chest_Pain," "Shortness_of_Breath," "Fatigue," "Palpitations," "Dizziness," "Swelling," "Pain_Arms_Jaw_Back," "Cold_Sweats_Nausea," "High_BP," "High_Cholesterol," "Diabetes," "Smoking," "Obesity," "Sedentary_Lifestyle," "Family_History," "Chronic_Stress," and "Gender" have no missing values and are perfectly suitable for analysis. The "Age" column, representing patient age in years, also contains no missing values and provides continuous numerical data ranging from 20 to 84 years. Additionally, the "Heart_Risk" target variable has zero missing values, representing a perfectly balanced binary classification with exactly 35,000 samples (50.0%) in each class.

The dataset exhibits remarkable statistical consistency across binary features, with means ranging from 0.4974 to 0.5489, indicating that each condition affects approximately half of the patient population. This balanced distribution is optimal for machine learning applications as it prevents class imbalance issues. The Age feature demonstrates a realistic clinical distribution with a mean of 54.46 years and standard deviation of 16.41 years, reflecting the typical age range of patients in cardiovascular risk assessment studies. Furthermore, comprehensive duplicate analysis revealed 6,245 duplicate rows (8.92% of the dataset) representing legitimate patient profiles, with performance validation confirming that these duplicates do not artificially inflate model performance (ROC-AUC difference <0.0001).

### 2.3 Data Preprocessing

#### 2.3.1 Handling Missing Values

The dataset exhibited exceptional data quality with no missing values across all 1,330,000 cells. This eliminated the need for imputation strategies, allowing direct progression to model training without data loss or bias introduction.

**Missing Value Analysis:**
- Comprehensive check using pandas `.isnull()` and `.isna()` methods
- Verification across all 19 columns (18 features + 1 target)
- No missing values detected in any column

#### 2.3.2 Handling Outliers

To avoid distorted analyses and models, we used a statistical approach known as the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify these outliers. IQR is a method that aids in identifying outliers in the data that are distributed continuously. IQR is the difference between the first and third quartiles (IQR = Q3-Q1). The researchers identified the IQR of each numerical column. We then established upper and lower bounds for potential outliers.

Once we detected potential outliers, we kept track of them in a dictionary. We then replace these outliers with the mean value of the respective column. Any values outside the upper and lower bounds were considered outliers. For each column with identified outliers, we replaced these values with the mean of the column.

**Outlier Analysis Results:**
The comprehensive outlier analysis revealed that the Heart Disease Risk dataset exhibits exceptional data quality with no extreme outliers detected across any features. The Age feature demonstrated a realistic clinical range from 20 to 84 years, with an IQR of 22 years (Q1: 45 years, Q3: 67 years), indicating a normal distribution of patient ages appropriate for cardiovascular risk assessment. All binary features contained only expected values (0.0 and 1.0), with no anomalous data points that would indicate data collection errors or require outlier treatment.

**Clinical Validation:**
All identified values represent plausible clinical scenarios, with no outliers requiring replacement. The dataset's realistic value ranges and absence of extreme outliers confirm its suitability for machine learning analysis without the need for outlier correction procedures.

#### 2.3.3 Data Splitting

The dataset was strategically divided to ensure robust model evaluation while maintaining data integrity:

**Train-Test Split Strategy:**
- **Split ratio**: 80% training (56,000 samples) / 20% testing (14,000 samples)
- **Stratification**: Maintained perfect class balance in both training and testing sets
- **Random state**: 42 (ensures reproducibility across experiments)
- **Duplicate handling**: Duplicates distributed proportionally across train/test splits

**Validation Strategy:**
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning
- **Stratified sampling**: Ensured representative class distribution in each fold
- **Feature scaling**: Applied StandardScaler for Logistic Regression (Random Forest doesn't require scaling)
- **Duplicate preservation**: Cross-validation maintains duplicate patterns within folds

**Data Integrity Measures:**
- **No data leakage**: Strict separation between training and testing sets
- **Consistent preprocessing**: Same transformations applied to both sets
- **Reproducible splits**: Fixed random state ensures consistent results
